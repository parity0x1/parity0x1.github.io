	<p><em>A parity bit is a check bit, which is added to a block of data for error detection purposes. It is used to validate the integrity of the data. The value of the parity bit is assigned either 0 or 1 that makes the number of 1s in the message block either even or odd depending upon the type of parity.</em></p>
