| Full write-ups can take a while, so instead of waiting for the whole thing to be done I'm going to rather update this page as I complete each one. There's 10 in total, so if you don't count 10 or if you're seeing this message, then I'm not done yet and you should come back in a day or two for more. Enjoy!

Hosted by TheCyberMentor, John Hammond and NahamSec, [NahamCon2021](https://www.nahamcon.com/) took place this past weekend.

With it came [NahamCon CTF 2021](https://ctftime.org/event/1281) - another opportunity for my CTF team [Hack South](https://hacksouth.africa/) to gain some [CTF Time](https://ctftime.org/team/120550) points.

48 hours later we placed a respectable 13/6491 players.
