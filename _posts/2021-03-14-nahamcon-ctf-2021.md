| Full write-ups can take a while, so instead of waiting for the whole thing to be done I'm going to rather update this page as I complete each one. There's 10 in total, so if you don't count 10 or if you're seeing this message, then I'm not done yet and you should come back in a day or two for more. Enjoy!

Hosted by TheCyberMentor, John Hammond and NahamSec, [NahamCon2021](https://www.nahamcon.com/) took place this past weekend.

With it came [NahamCon CTF 2021](https://ctftime.org/event/1281) - another opportunity for my CTF team [Hack South](https://hacksouth.africa/) to gain some [CTF Time](https://ctftime.org/team/120550) points.

48 hours later we placed a respectable 13/6491 players.

## <a name="3"></a>Treasure
This movie is what pushed me to get into hacking. Good luck decrypting my note, I'm elite.  

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Points:** 448  
**Category:** Cryptography  
**Solves:** 154

1. Download [note.txt](/assets/nahamconctf2021/03/note.txt) and [hackers.txt](/assets/nahamconctf2021/03/hackers.txt)
1. Taking a look at `note.txt` we see a familiar pattern; `flag{ xxxxxxxxx }`  
```
4661 [F] 5099 [L] 13243 [A] 11578 [G] { 14382 734 14024 10621 14382 2 3383 8702 6087 10621 7417 14382 12352 615 1208 4246 4657 9975 7203 2658 770 4 10621 8702 6125 980 9522 2659 14784 7203 8701 38 }
```
1. We can assume that the numbers must correlate to either letters or words in `hackers.txt` somehow. Perhaps this is a `book cipher`?
1. Visit [https://www.dcode.fr/book-cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/book-cipher) and paste in the text from the two files to see if it will decode anything
1. Nailed it!
