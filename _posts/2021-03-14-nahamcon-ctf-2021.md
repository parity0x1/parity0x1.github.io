> Full write-ups can take a while, so instead of waiting for the whole thing to be done I'm going to rather update this page as I complete each one. There's 10 in total, so if you don't count 10 or if you're seeing this message, then I'm not done yet and you should come back in a day or two for more. Enjoy!

Hosted by TheCyberMentor, John Hammond and NahamSec, [NahamCon2021](https://www.nahamcon.com/) took place this past weekend.

With it came [NahamCon CTF 2021](https://ctftime.org/event/1281) - another opportunity for my CTF team [Hack South](https://hacksouth.africa/) to gain some [CTF Time](https://ctftime.org/team/120550) points.

48 hours later we placed a respectable 13/6491 players.

## <a name="3"></a>Treasure
This movie is what pushed me to get into hacking. Good luck decrypting my note, I'm elite.  

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Category:** Cryptography  

1. Download [note.txt](/assets/nahamconctf2021/03/note.txt) and [hackers.txt](/assets/nahamconctf2021/03/hackers.txt)
1. Taking a look at `note.txt` we see a familiar pattern; `flag{ xxxxxxxxx }`  
```
4661 [F] 5099 [L] 13243 [A] 11578 [G] { 14382 734 14024 10621 14382 2 3383 8702 6087 10621 7417 14382 12352 615 1208 4246 4657 9975 7203 2658 770 4 10621 8702 6125 980 9522 2659 14784 7203 8701 38 }
```
1. We can assume that the numbers must correlate to either letters or words in `hackers.txt` somehow. Perhaps this is a `book cipher`?
1. Visit [https://www.dcode.fr/book-cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/book-cipher) and paste in the text from the two files to see if it will decode anything
1. Nailed it!

## <a name="4"></a>INE (Starter Pass)
Thanks to INE for helping sponsor NahamCon! You might find some good stuff here ;) https://checkout.ine.com/starter-pass

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Category:** Recon  

1. Visit [https://checkout.ine.com/starter-pass](https://checkout.ine.com/starter-pass)
1. Right-click on the page and select "View Page Source". Interestingly we don't see the expected HTML. This page must be built on the fly using Javascript
1. Right-click on the page and select "Inspect Element". Now we can see all of the HTML
1. Right-click on the `html` tag and select `copy > outer html` and paste the source in a text editor
1. Inspecting the source (towards the bottom) we find `ZmxhZ3syOWZhMzA1YWFmNWUwMWU5ZWRjZjAxNDJlNGRkY2RiOX0=` which looks like a base64 encoded string

1. Let's drop this into [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and see if we can find anything interesting
1. Gotcha

## <a name="5"></a>Google Play

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Category:** Recon  

![](/assets/nahamconctf2021/05/01.png)

1. Google "GPSRP" and visit the result https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/play-rewards/
1. Hit `CTRL+F` and type `class`
1. Cycle through the results until you find a link to a [PDF](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/play-rewards/Android_app_vulnerability_classes.pdf_) with more information on vulnerability classes. Open the PDF.
1. Hit `CTRL+F` again and type `class` to look through the PDF
1. Weird, why is there a 'blank' section of the PDF showing up as a result? Copy the 'blank' section and paste it in a text editor.
1. Sneaky, there's the flag!
