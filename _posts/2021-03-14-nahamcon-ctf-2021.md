Hosted by TheCyberMentor, John Hammond and NahamSec, [NahamCon2021](https://www.nahamcon.com/) took place this past weekend.

With it came [NahamCon CTF 2021](https://ctftime.org/event/1281) - another opportunity for my CTF team [Hack South](https://hacksouth.africa/) to gain some [CTF Time](https://ctftime.org/team/120550) points.

48 hours later we placed a respectable 13/6491 players.

## <a name="3"></a>Treasure
This movie is what pushed me to get into hacking. Good luck decrypting my note, I'm elite.  

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Category:** Cryptography  

1. Download [note.txt](/assets/nahamconctf2021/03/note.txt) and [hackers.txt](/assets/nahamconctf2021/03/hackers.txt)
1. Taking a look at `note.txt` we see a familiar pattern; `flag{ xxxxxxxxx }`  
```
4661 [F] 5099 [L] 13243 [A] 11578 [G] { 14382 734 14024 10621 14382 2 3383 8702 6087 10621 7417 14382 12352 615 1208 4246 4657 9975 7203 2658 770 4 10621 8702 6125 980 9522 2659 14784 7203 8701 38 }
```
1. We can assume that the numbers must correlate to either letters or words in `hackers.txt` somehow. Perhaps this is a `book cipher`?
1. Visit [https://www.dcode.fr/book-cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/book-cipher) and paste in the text from the two files to see if it will decode anything
1. Nailed it!

## <a name="4"></a>INE (Starter Pass)
Thanks to INE for helping sponsor NahamCon! You might find some good stuff here ;) https://checkout.ine.com/starter-pass

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Category:** Recon  

1. Visit [https://checkout.ine.com/starter-pass](https://checkout.ine.com/starter-pass)
1. Right-click on the page and select "View Page Source". Interestingly we don't see the expected HTML. This page must be built on the fly using Javascript
1. Right-click on the page and select "Inspect Element". Now we can see all of the HTML
1. Right-click on the `html` tag and select `copy > outer html` and paste the source in a text editor
1. Inspecting the source (towards the bottom) we find `ZmxhZ3syOWZhMzA1YWFmNWUwMWU5ZWRjZjAxNDJlNGRkY2RiOX0=` which looks like a base64 encoded string  

![](/assets/nahamconctf2021/04/01.png)  

1. Let's drop this into [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and see if we can find anything interesting
1. Gotcha

## <a name="5"></a>Google Play

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Category:** Recon  

![](/assets/nahamconctf2021/05/01.png)

1. Google "GPSRP" and visit the result https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/play-rewards/
1. Hit `CTRL+F` and type `class`
1. Cycle through the results until you find a link to a [PDF](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/play-rewards/Android_app_vulnerability_classes.pdf_) with more information on vulnerability classes. Open the PDF.
1. Hit `CTRL+F` again and type `class` to look through the PDF
1. Weird, why is there a 'blank' section of the PDF showing up as a result? Copy the 'blank' section and paste it in a text editor.
1. Sneaky, there's the flag!

## <a name="6"></a>Asserted
Time to hit the gym! Assert all of your energy! Err, wait, is the saying "exert" all your energy? I don't know.  
The flag is in `/flag.txt`.

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Category:** Web

1. Start the machine and visit the provided URL. After clicking around for a bit you'll see a GET param `?page=...`
1. We can check whether this page is vulnerable to LFI (local file inclusion) by trying to access the flag directly using `?page=../../../../../../../../flag.txt`. No luck!

![](/assets/nahamconctf2021/06/01.png)

1. Perhaps we can grab the source code using [php::/filter](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/file-inclusion#wrapper-php-filter). Change the page param as follows: `?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php`. If vulnerable, this will output the source as a base64 encoded string which you can decode and inspect.

![](/assets/nahamconctf2021/06/03.png)

1. Looking at the source code we see the use of the `assert` function. Here, the assert function is testing for the presence of `..` but the input ($file) is not being sanitized. We can breakout of this call and retrieve the flag with this payload:

```
', '..') === false and $myfile = fopen("/flag.txt", "r") and exit(fread($myfile,filesize("/flag.txt"))) or true or strpos('
```

## <a name="7"></a>Bad Blog
We just added analytics to our blogging website. Check them out.

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Category:** Web

1. Start by creating a user account.
1. After publishing and visiting your blog post you'll notice that `user agents` are being captured and stored for analytics.
1. Open BurpSuite and change the user agent to `' || (SELECT password from user WHERE id=1) || '`. We are assuming that the admin user will have an ID of `1`.

![](/assets/nahamconctf2021/07/01.png)

1. Viewing the analytics now reveals the administrators password which we can use to log in as admin and get the flag.

## <a name="8"></a>Imposter
Are you who you say you are? How can you be not?

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Category:** Web

1. Signup and intercept with BurpSuite
1. Note QR code generator response: 
```
"url":"otpauth://totp/2Password:parity?secret=OBQXE2LUPEYTEMZUGU3DOOBZ&issuer=2Password"
```

![](/assets/nahamconctf2021/08/01.png)

1. CyberChef detects `base32` and `OBQXE2LUPEYTEMZUGU3DOOBZ` is `parity123456789`
1. Assuming admin account we can base32 encode `admin123456789` and create a new QR code generator response:

![](/assets/nahamconctf2021/08/02.png)

```
otpauth://totp/2Password:admin?secret=MFSG22LOGEZDGNBVGY3TQOI&issuer=2Password
```

1. Generate a QR code at [https://stefansundin.github.io/2fa-qr/](https://stefansundin.github.io/2fa-qr/) and add to your authenticator app
1. Now reset the admin password by manipulating the `reset_password` call in BurpSuite: `"email":"nxjlkvzgarjinuoajl@mhzayt.online;admin@congon4tor.me"`. [https://10minutemail.com/](https://10minutemail.com/)

![](/assets/nahamconctf2021/08/03.png)

1. Follow the reset link that will be mailed to you and change the admin password

![](/assets/nahamconctf2021/08/04.png)

1. You can now log in using the new password and OTP and retrieve the flag.
